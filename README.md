## Setup

### Installation
- Install dependencies
    ```
    yarn
    ```

### Development

1.- Add a 12 phrase mnemonic phrase in the `.env` file on the `BCAPP_KEY_MNEMONIC` variable, you can generate and see your keys and addresses (here)[https://iancoleman.io/bip39/], use 12 words, select ETH and use BIP 44.
2.- Configure your `.env` file, make sure to set the environment to develop, see the `.env.example` file.
4.- Start the local testnet, it will deploy new orgs based in the configuration from `src/config/contracts.json` file. Once the deployment finish it will update the file with the testing addresses of the DAT in develop for the app.
    ```
    yarn run dev
    ```

    ```
    yarn start
    ```
    
### Kovan developement

You can use the default contracts deployed in `src/config/contracts.json` or deploy new ones deploy in kovan by executing `yarn run deploy --network kovan`. You will need to have balance in the account index 1 generated from your mnemonic key.
